Based on these indexes 10/30/98 = 100. IGBVL: It reflects the overall trend in the prices of shares listed on the main stock exchange, according to a select portfolio, which currently represents the 36 most traded stocks in the market. Your calculation includes price changes and dividends or bonus shares distributed, and the share subscription. Its base date December 30, 1991 = 100. In order to keep constantly updated portfolio of IGBVL, has seen fit to carry out a review every six months, having been defined on 02 January and 1 July as the dates for the enforcement of the current portfolio. However, if market conditions so state, the portfolios may remain unchanged, which will be communicated promptly to the market. ISBVL: \tAs of July 1993, has been calculated the Selective Index of the Lima Stock Exchange (ISBVL) indicator measures changes in the prices of the 15 most representative Shares Stock Exchange Lima. This index allows to show the trend of the stock market in terms of the changes that occur in the prices of the 15 most representative actions.

Similarly applying for calculating the price keeps ISBVL total agreement with that applied to the General Index.",
