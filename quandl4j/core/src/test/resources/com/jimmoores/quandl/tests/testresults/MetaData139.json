The Index point for each subsequent month represents that month's volume in relation to the January 1990 baseline.  Each month's volumes are adjusted to provide an average 21-day work month. Adjustments also are made to compensate for business additions/deletions to the volume figures. These adjustments help normalize the data to provide a sound basis for ongoing monthly comparison.",
