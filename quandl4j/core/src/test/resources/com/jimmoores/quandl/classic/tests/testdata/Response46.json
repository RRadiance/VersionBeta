When buying and selling bonds, investors include their expectations of  future inflation, real interest rates and their assessment of risks. An investor calculates the price of a bond by discounting the expected future cash flows (coupon payments and/or redemption).\r\nECB estimates zero-coupon yield curves for the euro area and also derives forward and par yield curves. A zero cupon bond is a bond that pays no cupon and is sold at a discount from its face value. The zero coupon curve represents the yield to maturity of hypothetical zero coupon bonds, since they are not directly observable in the market for a wide range of maturities. They must therfore be estimatedfrom existing zero coupon bonds and fixed coupon bond prices or yields. \r\nThe forward curve shows the short-term (instantaneous) interest rate for future periods implied in the yield curve.\r\nThe par yield reflects hypothetical yields, namely the interest rates the bonds would have yielded had they been priced at par (i.e. at 100).\nFull metadata at: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_SDDS/EN/irt_euryld_esms.htm","updated_at":"2014-12-08T05:09:49.089Z","frequency":"monthly","from_date":"2012-06-30","to_date":"2014-11-30","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":1057270,"source_name":"Geo3 Data Compendium","source_code":"GEOCOMP","code":"0_0_0_12","name":"Emissions of CO2 - from Industrial Processes (UNFCCC) (Australia)","urlize_name":"Emissions-of-CO2-from-Industrial-Processes-UNFCCC-Australia","display_url":"http://geocompendium.grid.unep.ch/data_sets/atmosphere/data/emissions_co2_industrialprocess_unfccc.htm","description":"This site (http://ghg.unfccc.int) contains summary tables and an on-line database of emission estimates for three main gases: CO2, CH4, N2O, as well as for CO, NOX, NMVOCs, and SO2.
