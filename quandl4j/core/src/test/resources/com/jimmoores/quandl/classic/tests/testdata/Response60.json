The misery index was initiated by economist Arthur Okun, an adviser to President Lyndon Johnson in the 1960's. It is simply the unemployment rate added to the inflation rate. It is assumed that both a higher rate of unemployment and a worsening of inflation both create economic and social costs for a country. A combination of rising inflation and more people out of work implies a deterioration in economic performance and a rise in the misery index.","updated_at":"2015-06-22T04:14:11.913Z","frequency":"monthly","from_date":"1948-01-31","to_date":"2015-05-31","column_names":["Month","Unemployment Rate","Inflation Rate","Misery Index"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2450421,"source_name":"Gallup","source_code":"GALLUP","code":"GUNS1","name":"United States Household Gun Ownership","urlize_name":"United-States-Household-Gun-Ownership","display_url":"http://www.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx","description":"Number of American households with a gun in the home.","updated_at":"2014-09-08T16:07:20.625Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Year","% of Homes with Guns"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2450429,"source_name":"Gallup","source_code":"GALLUP","code":"GUNSINSCHOOL","name":"Public Opinion on Arming School Officials","urlize_name":"Public-Opinion-on-Arming-School-Officials","display_url":"http://www.gallup.com/poll/1645/guns.aspx","description":"Single date survey asking Americans \"Do you think schools would be safer places or more dangerous places if school officials were armed with guns?\"  Units: %","updated_at":"2014-09-10T21:47:37.447Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"2005-12-31","to_date":"2005-12-31","column_names":["Year","Safer","More Dangerous","Depends","No Opinion"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2450424,"source_name":"James Alan Fox","source_code":"JFOX","code":"MASSMURDER1","name":"Mass Murders in the United States 1980 - 2010","urlize_name":"Mass-Murders-in-the-United-States-1980-2010","display_url":"http://boston.com/community/blogs/crime_punishment/2012/08/no_increase_in_mass_shootings.html","description":"Number of victims and number of Offenders","updated_at":"2014-09-08T19:46:22.788Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1980-12-31","to_date":"2010-12-31","column_names":["Year","Number of Victims","Number of Offenders"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2450426,"source_name":"US Disaster Center","source_code":"DISASTERCENTER","code":"RATES","name":"US Crime Rates per 100,000 persons","urlize_name":"US-Crime-Rates-per-100-000-persons","display_url":"http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm","description":"US Crime Rates per 100,000 persons as aggregated by the US Disaster Center from FBI data","updated_at":"2014-09-10T21:47:33.491Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Total","Violent","Property","Murder","Forcible Rape","Robbery","Aggr Assault","Burglary","Larceny Theft","Vehicle Theft"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2450427,"source_name":"US Disaster Center","source_code":"DISASTERCENTER","code":"LEVELS","name":"US Crime Levels","urlize_name":"US-Crime-Levels","display_url":"http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm","description":"US Crime Rates as aggregated by the US Disaster Center from FBI data","updated_at":"2014-09-08T16:12:20.326Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2012-12-31","column_names":["Date","Total","Violent","Property","Murder","Forcible Rape","Robbery","Aggr Assault","Burglary","Larceny Theft","Vehicle Theft"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":2630002,"source_name":"Angus Maddison","source_code":"MADDISON","code":"GDPPC_CIV","name":"GDP Per Capita of Ivory Coast","urlize_name":"GDP-Per-Capita-of-Ivory-Coast","display_url":"http://www.ggdc.net/MADDISON/Historical_Statistics/vertical-file_02-2010.xls","description":"Angus Maddison was a world scholar on quantitative macroeconomic\n    history, including the measurement and analysis of economic growth and\n    development.
