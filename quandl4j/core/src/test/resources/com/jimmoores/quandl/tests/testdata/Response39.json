High Priced IPOs refers to the percentage of IPOs that priced above the midpoint of the original \r\nfile price range.\r\nThe returns are based on a more restrictive definition of what is an IPO (the net count): Closed-end funds, REITs, acquisition companies, offer prices below $5, ADRs, \r\nlimited partnerships,units, banks and S&Ls, and those not listed on CRSP are excluded, starting in 1986 and later years. The series for the percentage that priced above the original range begins \r\nin January 1980. This series excludes IPOs with an original file price range midpoint of below $8, in addition to the other screens. Some months, the percentage is based on a sample size \r\nof 1 or 2 IPOs, even when the gross count is higher. In particular, in 1980 there were only 50 IPOs that qualified for this calculation, even though the gross volume count is much higher.\r\nNet volume starts in Jan. 1975, and the percentage pricing above the file price midpoint starts in Jan. 1980.\r\nIn January 2013 some of the numbers from 1986-2000 were revised, especially the average first-day returns.","updated_at":"2014-07-31T05:05:40.795Z","frequency":"monthly","from_date":"1960-01-31","to_date":"2014-03-31","column_names":["Date","Gross Number of IPOs","Net Number of IPOs","High Priced IPOs","Average First-Day Return"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":6725677,"source_name":"Cooley Venture Financing Report","source_code":"COOLEY","code":"VC_TOTAL_DEAL_VOLUME","name":"Venture Capital - Total Deal Volume","urlize_name":"Venture-Capital-Total-Deal-Volume","display_url":"http://www.cooley.com/search.aspx?searchtext=venture%20financing%20report","description":"This data provides a summary of data reflecting our experience in venture capital financing terms and trends.
