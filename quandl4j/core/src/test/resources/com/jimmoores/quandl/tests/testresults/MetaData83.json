      "description": "The Recession, Expansion & Contraction Index (RECI); The RECI, published quarterly, is a leading economic indicator designed to pinpoint early shifts in the US Business and Economic Cycles. From the raw data, over a dozen moving average measurements for each data-point was generate and then relational data was generated and averaged from that, resulting in several thousand unique data-points. Index Weighting; Raw and relational moving average data was then classified several million times for impact and forecasting quality through a genetic programming application in a distributive processing environment. Data with the highest forecasting quality was weighted and included in the index. Cyclical Measurement; The final weighted index is updated regularly, detrended and passed through a proprietary cyclical algorithm to produce clear peaks and troughs. The Indicator can be interpreted as follows: * A move to zero indicates a recession is nearing the end of its cycle and companies, while exercising caution and watching for improvements in data, should begin planning for re-entry into an expanding economy. * A move to 100 signals the economy is peaking. Like troughs these tops can persist for an extended period of time or reverse quickly. A move down form this level signals contraction and firms should prepare for those potentials. This may be one of the most important triggers in the early signal model as it happens well in advance of the Recession Trigger and can add depth to what-if scenarios. * A move below 50 is a red-flag event. This is our Early Recession Warning and should prompt companies to review recession what-if scenarios developed earlier in the cycle. This trigger typically occurs before the official start of a recession, giving firms time to implement changes in spending and investment.",
