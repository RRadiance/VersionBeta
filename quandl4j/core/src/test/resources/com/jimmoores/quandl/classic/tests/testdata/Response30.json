From the raw data, over a dozen moving average measurements for each data-point was generate and then relational data was generated and averaged from that, resulting in several thousand unique data-points. Index Weighting; Raw and relational moving average data was then classified several million times for impact and forecasting quality through a genetic programming application in a distributive processing environment. Data with the highest forecasting quality was weighted and included in the index. Cyclical Measurement; The final weighted index is updated regularly, detrended and passed through a proprietary cyclical algorithm to produce clear peaks and troughs. The Indicator can be interpreted as follows: * A move to zero indicates a recession is nearing the end of its cycle and companies, while exercising caution and watching for improvements in data, should begin planning for re-entry into an expanding economy. * A move to 100 signals the economy is peaking. Like troughs these tops can persist for an extended period of time or reverse quickly. A move down form this level signals contraction and firms should prepare for those potentials. This may be one of the most important triggers in the early signal model as it happens well in advance of the Recession Trigger and can add depth to what-if scenarios. * A move below 50 is a red-flag event. This is our Early Recession Warning and should prompt companies to review recession what-if scenarios developed earlier in the cycle. This trigger typically occurs before the official start of a recession, giving firms time to implement changes in spending and investment.","updated_at":"2014-02-07T16:53:49.760Z","frequency":"quarterly","from_date":"1954-04-01","to_date":"2013-04-01","column_names":["Date","Value"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7970668,"source_name":"Portugal Contemporary Database (Pordata)","source_code":"PORDATA","code":"1933","name":"Portugal Population, Marriages and Divorces, Catholic and non-catholic marriages","urlize_name":"Portugal-Population-Marriages-and-Divorces-Catholic-and-non-catholic-marriages","display_url":"http://www.pordata.pt/en/Portugal/Marriages+between+people+of+the+opposite+sex+total+and+by+type+of+ceremony-1933","description":"Records\n","updated_at":"2014-09-18T11:13:30.332Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1990-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Years","Total","Civil","Catholic","Unknown/Other"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7970669,"source_name":"Portugal Contemporary Database (Pordata)","source_code":"PORDATA","code":"651","name":"Portugal Population, Marriages and Divorces, Crude divorce rate","urlize_name":"Portugal-Population-Marriages-and-Divorces-Crude-divorce-rate","display_url":"http://www.pordata.pt/en/Portugal/Crude+divorce+rate-651","description":"Rate â€° - per thousand\n","updated_at":"2014-09-26T06:52:36.426Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Years","Crude divorce rate"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false},{"id":7970670,"source_name":"Portugal Contemporary Database (Pordata)","source_code":"PORDATA","code":"530","name":"Portugal Population, Marriages and Divorces, Crude marriage rate","urlize_name":"Portugal-Population-Marriages-and-Divorces-Crude-marriage-rate","display_url":"http://www.pordata.pt/en/Portugal/Crude+marriage+rate-530","description":"Rate â€° - per thousand\n","updated_at":"2014-09-25T13:33:15.208Z","frequency":"annual","from_date":"1960-12-31","to_date":"2013-12-31","column_names":["Years","Crude marriage rate"],"private":false,"type":null,"premium":false}],"sources":[{"id":929,"code":"NYXDATA","datasets_count":1,"description":"Historical and current securities market credit data from the NYSE.","name":"NYSE Factbook","host":"http://www.nyxdata.com/","premium":false},{"id":932,"code":"AOFM","datasets_count":1,"description":"No description for this database yet.","name":"Australian Office of Financial Management","host":"www.aofm.gov.au","premium":false},{"id":933,"code":"AUS_BUDGET","datasets_count":1,"description":"No description for this database yet.","name":"Australian Governement Budget","host":"www.budget.gov.au","premium":false},{"id":937,"code":"NAB","datasets_count":1,"description":"Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM) is a specialist Australian Government agency responsible for management of Australian Government debt.","name":"National Australia Bank","host":"business.nab.com.au","premium":false},{"id":938,"code":"ACCI","datasets_count":1,"description":"ACCI's Economic Surveys Provide regular & authoritative data & analysis about the experiences, attitudes concerns of businesses of all sizes in all industry sectors across Australia.","name":"Australia Chamber of Commerce and Industry","host":"www.acci.asn.au","premium":false},{"id":940,"code":"WESTPAC","datasets_count":1,"description":"Sentiment data from the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research.","name":"Westpac Bank","host":"www.westpac.com.au","premium":false},{"id":953,"code":"ANZ","datasets_count":1,"description":"Statistics on Newspaper and Internet Job Advertisements in Australia and New Zealand.","name":"Australia and New Zealand Banking Group","host":"www.anz.com/","premium":false},{"id":964,"code":"NSIS","datasets_count":12292,"description":"Official statistical agency of Spain has data on demography, economy, and society of Spain and other countries.
